### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A challenge I encountered while building the app was creating the Superhero Network Request.  At first, the code wasn't displaying the super hero movies that I wanted on the Super hero screen. I was able able to use the API by copy and pasting it to the code that was part of the Superhero Network Request and I was able to display the movies that I wanted. Also a challenge I encountered was resizing the movie posters which were small in size and needed to be evenly spaced out. I was able to challenge myself by trying to find the solution on my own before looking at the provided solution. Another challenge I encountered was changing some of the screens color backgrounds, since it would cut out some of the information that was being displayed. I was able to test new approaches on story board in order to successfully change the background colors.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A challenge I encountered while building the app was creating a good size movie cell in order to fit all of the content view which included a title label, synopsis label, and poster view, which I was able to do. Also, a challenge I encountered was trying to create a file in the new Xcode menu on my own before noticing the drop down button at the bottom of the instructions on how to create a file with the Cocoa Touch Class, which helped me understand the process. Another challenge I encountered was installing AlamoFireImage using Swift Package Manager (SPM), since I wasn't able to create a path to my app through the terminal in order to successfully create pods, which I ended up figuring out.
